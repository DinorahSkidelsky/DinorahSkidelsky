<h1 class="border bottom"> ¡Hi there! I'm Dinorah, Full Stack Web Developer 👩‍💻 </h1>

<p> I consider myself a <strong>responsible and proactive</strong> person in terms of deadlines and objectives to meet. I enjoy learning new technologies and improving myself day by day, working as a team, contributing new ideas and at the same time listening to those of my colleagues. I am also a lawyer, which gave me experience in dealing with the client and in solving problems </p>
